# PSX Doom+

PSX Doom with upgrades. Unlocking secrets throughout the campaign gives currency to upgrade Doomguy's stats. Each secret gives 10 currency. Upgrades last until the end of a megawad. So upgrades will reset when finishing Doom 1.

This is version 3.9.1 of PSX Doom. This mod does not include the PSX Doom addons:

- PSXDOOM.CE.Maps.LostLevels.pk3
- PSXDOOM.CE.Addon.SFX.HQ.pk3
- PSXDOOM.CE.Addon.GFX.PBR.pk3
- PSXDOOM.CE.Addon.GFX.Parallax.pk3
- PSXDOOM.CE.Addon.GFX.Extra.pk3
- PSXDOOM.CE.Addon.GFX.Decals.pk3
- PSXDOOM.CE.Addon.GFX.Brightmaps.pk3
- PSXDOOM.CE.Addon.BGM.Extended.pk3

If you would like to include these addons, [download the full version here](https://www.moddb.com/mods/doom-ce/downloads/psx-doom-ce-391-full-download), and extract the pk3 files.

P.S. - This was my first mod for GZDoom, I might come back to this to polish it up.
